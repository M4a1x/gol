Conway's Game of Life in Rust
=============================

Goal
----

The goal of this is to show possible implementations of the famous Game of Life in Rust in various degrees of optimization. This is mainly a project for me to learn the language and might be useful to others.


Requirements
------------

The branches `optimize` and `reference` need `gperftools` to be installed on the system.
